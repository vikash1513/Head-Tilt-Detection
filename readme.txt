Head Tilt Detection is a computer vision task that aims to measure the angle of the head in 
an image or video. The angle is defined as the deviation of the head from the vertical axis, 
which can be positive (tilted to the right) or negative (tilted to the left). The task can be 
useful for applications such as face recognition, emotion recognition, gesture recognition, 
and human-computer interaction.
The task can be formulated as a regression or classification problem, depending on the 
output format. For regression, the output is a continuous value that represents the angle of 
the head in degrees. For classification, the output is a discrete label that corresponds to 
one of the predefined angle ranges, such as 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, etc.
The task can be solved using various methods, such as deep learning, geometric analysis, 
or landmark detection
